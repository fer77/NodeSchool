// Write a node program that prints a buffer object containing the string "bytewiser" using console.log.
console.log(new Buffer('bytewiser'));

// In Node.js, Buffer is a global object that provides a way to work with different
// kinds of binary data. Most APIs in Node core (e.g. http, net, fs) will give you
// buffers, and will be able to do their job faster if you give them buffers.
